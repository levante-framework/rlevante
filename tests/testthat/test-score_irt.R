# Regression test for the score_irt() column-order bug.
#
# mirt::fscores(mod, response.pattern = data) matches the columns of
# response.pattern to the model's items *by position, not by name* (verified:
# reordering named columns changes the returned theta). score_irt() must
# therefore reorder its data to items(mod_rec) before scoring. If it does not,
# each response vector is scored against a permuted item set, producing wrong
# (but plausible-looking) abilities.
#
# The fixture (irt_fixture_2pl, in helper-irt.R) uses a 2PL model with varying
# discrimination: under a Rasch model the raw score is sufficient for EAP, so
# permuting columns of complete data would not change the score and could not
# detect the bug.
