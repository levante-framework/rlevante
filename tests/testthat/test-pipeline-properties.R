# Correctness / property tests for the scoring pipeline.
#
# Unlike characterization tests (which pin current behavior), these assert
# properties that *should* hold regardless of implementation, so they can fail
# and reveal real bugs. The original column-order bug corrupted individual theta
# values while barely changing their rank order -- so a "recovered scores
# correlate with the truth" check is a WEAK detector of it (see the coarse
# recovery test below). The sharp detectors are value-level: reproducing the
# model's own calibration EAP scores (see test-score_irt.R) and using the right
# group's prior (below).

  # were extracted, a child would be scored against the wrong prior. Scoring

  # different answers than if the same responses were mislabeled as g1.
